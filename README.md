# Go-Gorilla-Websocket

This repository is an experimental project aimed at learning and utilizing the Go programming language with the Gorilla Websocket library. The goal is to develop a chat bot and explore various use cases for websockets.

## Description

Websockets are a communication protocol that allows for real-time, bidirectional communication between a client (usually a web browser) and a server. This project leverages the Gorilla Websocket library, a popular Go package, to implement a basic websocket server.

## Features

- Establishes a websocket server using the Gorilla Websocket library
- Handles incoming websocket connections and messages
- Provides a home page to demonstrate basic HTTP functionality
- Supports bidirectional communication between clients and the server
